Hi there

So' I've done it to the best I can do now,
I think I've done a fairly good job, though I'm also sure, with professional eyes it will have many flaws,
tested on edge, chrome and opera.
To make it work you need a
database called db_contact
with a user called contact_user
who has a password contactpwd
and has at least rights to select insert and execute on the database
and for jquery it needs internet connection as its using google's libs

I hope you will like it and we speak soon

Kind Regards
